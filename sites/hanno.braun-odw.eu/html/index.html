                I always have an ongoing side project, and I try to work on it every day. Here's a list of projects I've completed recently.

                        <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot" target="_blank">Fornjot</a> is an experimental programmatic CAD system. I've been working on multiple iterations of it over a few years, and this is the first public release.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal for this first release was to build enough infrastructure to support <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot/tree/main/models/spacer" target="_blank">a simple spacer model</a>. I plan to extend it and create more complex models going forward.

                        I revamped my website (the one you're looking at right now) and put it on new technical footing, using my own <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/braun-odw.eu" target="_blank">homegrown static site generator</a>. I also got a new domain and started consolidating most of my IT infrastructure (including email and Matrix homeserver) under it.

                        <a href="https://github.com/hannobraun/my-boss" target="_blank">My Boss</a> is software that tells me what to do and when to do it. Kind of like an ERP system, except that I'm the opposite of an enterprise. This was the initial release that included contact management functionality, kind of like a CRM. I use it every day to remember to keep in touch with my business contacts (and actually also some personal ones). I plan to extend it in the future to encompass more areas of my business, like basic bookkeeping and possibly more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still don't know how I feel about re-inventing the wheel like this, but as long as the alternatives are really complicated, hard to maintain, proprietary web software that I could lose access to any moment, or otherwise don't suit my needs, I guess I'll keep doing it. My Boss is a command-line application and stores its data in TOML files that I keep in a Git repository, and it doesn't get much easier (for me) than that.
